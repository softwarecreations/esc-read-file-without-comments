# esc-read-file-without-comments
Read file without comments (lines starting with #)

## Installation
`npm install esc-read-file-without-comments`

## Use
```JavaScript
import readFileWithoutComments from 'esc-read-file-without-comments';
const hosts = readFileWithoutComments('/etc/hosts');
```

## Project goals
* Lightweight: 168 bytes of code
* No dependencies
* No nonsense
* Reliable, no radical changes will ever happen.
* Small, simple, easy to audit, yourself

If I have ideas for something different, I'll make a new package rather than make breaking changes.

## Notes
Have fun!
